I like simplicity and elegance in almost every aspect of life, food being the only exception. I'm currently a data scientist in Seattle at [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com) and am very passionate about the algorithms and tools involved in my trade. However, as someone pointed out (I don't remember who) it's a little upsetting that some of the smartest people of my generation are concentrating their mental efforts on how to make more people click on banner ads. 

Before my job at Zillow I was a PhD student at the University of Michigan where I wrote a [blog](http://www.rackham.umich.edu/blog/16) occasionally. One blog I wrote was about my experience going to a dozen or so espresso joints in Ann Arbor on a single day. On that day I learned a valuable lesson about moderation. The blogs were a lot more fun to write than my PhD, which was about constructing surrogate models for expensive computer codes and can be found [here](https://github.com/yankovai/Thesis). 

Before deciding to get a PhD I attended the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in the quaint town of Terre Haute, Indiana. At Rose I participated in Operation Catapult, Fast Track Calculus and gained an appreciation for a prank. In fact, one time I played a prank with Peyton Manning and a few other members of the Indianapolis Colts. All I'll say is the prank involved a golf cart, a lake, and a bunch of super nerdy "Fast Track Calculus" students fresh out of high school. 

Intertwined in these years I met my wife at a Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Brigham Young University (neither of us are Mormon) and saw [Cherenkov radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation) during an internship at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. To this day, I reckon I had the best burrito of my life in Idaho Falls and yes, it did contain potatoes.

I'd like to use this blog for:

* Teaching some data science tidbits I picked up
* Rambling about other topics that I'm passionate about
